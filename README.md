# MC322 2021s1 Project

This is a group assignment from the group *Duocomop√©da* of UNICAMP - **Universidade Estadual de Campinas**.

## Requirement
The project was developed for JRE JavaSE-1.8

## Build
To build the project, compile all `.java` files under `src/` folder, or simply use an IDE.

## Usage
There are two `main()` functions in the package `com.unicamp.mc322.duocomopeda.main`
# Testing Environment
This will run the game with predefined names, decks and no mulligan. To run it, simply type in terminal:
```shell
$ java path/to/main/package/Tester
```
# Production Environment
To run the actual game, type in terminal:
```shell
$ java path/to/main/package/Main
```
## Game Rules
Most rules are the same as the original game [**Legends of Runeterra**](https://playruneterra.com/en-us/).
Every interaction in the game (except the initial name input) is done by inputing a number as prompted and pressing Enter.
